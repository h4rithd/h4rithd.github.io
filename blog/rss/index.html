This might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems, and sensitive operating system files. In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server. <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></blockquote><p>We can easily check this using burp suite repeater tab.
